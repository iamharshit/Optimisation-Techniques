## Least Squares Approximation

It is a technique to find the best solution for `A*X = B` where X,B are vectors and A is a vector.In Layman terms we find the approximate solution for set of equations where there are more no. of equations then no. of variables.I tried to implement the same where we enter the equations and it gives us the most optimal solution

### Basic Usage
* Run `julia main.jl`
* Note: While entering equations donot leave any space in between, if the coefficient is 1 then do enter 1.Also enter variables as x1,x2,x3......
